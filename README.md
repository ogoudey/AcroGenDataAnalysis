# Offline data processing
This project is used for processing the data collected by CALM-GEN/[AcroGen](https://github.com/ogoudey/AcroGen). Algorithm is based off the Tuft's HRILab's [workload_analysis](https://github.com/hrilabtufts/workload_analysis) project.

### Suggestions for improvements
- The experiments should capture brightness at a maximum framerate during calibration.
- This repo should support more plotting capabilities (multiple subjects, etc).
- Make sure that this formula is correct... so far no confirmation of any kind of the "arousal" metric.
